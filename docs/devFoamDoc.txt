l a 3 linear axes + 1 rotational axis like this . This is called a Tangential cut machine.You need the Pro version to to that
l

2D mode is a way to drive the 4 axes where each carriage follow a path identical to the other one.
It's called 2D mode as the cut Part is an extrusion of the original 2D geomerty.
You can see an example in the picture below, where the Red lines are the Cutting Paths the each carrage.

The 3D mode instead has different Paths at left and right carriages.
If you are going to cut Tapered Parts, may be you can find useful these applications:

Let's come back to devFoam.....
I suggest also to take a look at this page, to better understand some important concepts of devFoam: DevFoam FAQ and important concepts

devFoam - FAQ

The basic concepts of CNC Foam Cutting

The basic concepts of CNC Foam Cutting
The idea is very simple: two carriages (left and right) move a hot wire along a Cutting Path.
The hot wire melts the Foam and cut it. See the photo below, where you can see the 2 carriages and the hot wire

The concept is similar to a 3 axis CNC milling machine, where a milling tool can cut parts, following the Cutting Path .
What makes the process difficoult in Foam cutting is the impossibility to break the Cutting Path and start it again. 3 axys milling machines simply raise the tool over the material to do
that, but that is not possible here.
So the idea here is to build a single continuos Cutting Path .
Let's make an example: we want to cut 'A' and 'B' letters. See the picture below:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 5 of 44

The pink shapes are the geometries of the 2 letters, and the black line is the cutting path created by devFoam. In the bottom left side you can see the Home (the starting/ending point of
the travel of the hot wire). Following the arrows you can see how the external and internal contours of the letters are cut connecting the letters and making a (as little as possible)
cut crossing the letters themselves.
The user can also go in edit mode, and move the entry/exit points dragging the blue control points. See the below picture

But this is not important here, as it's an advanced feature....
In the picture below you can see the 3D preview of the cutting job
The red lines show the real cutting path of each carriage, the green lines the connecting lines, and in orange/cyan the cut parts

Cutting a text

Cutting a text
You can create here 1 or more text lines rendered with a Windows font.
If you need more advanced features like a modified text see How can I cut a more complex text?
To cut a single text You can start the process clicking the first option in the Startup dialog or by the menu "Cut - Cut a text ".
The following dialog will appear:

You can write 1 or more line of text in the edit control placed in the left-upper part of the dialog.
Using the options in the 'Font' frame you can select the Font name, style, height and these more advanced options:
Upside down: revert the font to upside-down. The order of the lines is not affected
Backwards: revert the font front-rear. The order of the letters is not affected
l Width factor: you can specify the width of the font. The larger the value, the wider the font. Default = 1.0
l Oblique angle: you can apply a slant angle to the font
l X Spacing factor: you can modify the horizontal space among the letters, using 100% the default spacing defined by the Font will be applied
l Y Spacing factor: you can modify the vertical space among the rows, using 100% the default spacing will be applied
l
l

Using fonts like Webdings, Wingdings and so on, you can also cut symbols and shapes, see the example below:

Now you are ready to go to the next step, to create the Cutting path
You can select between:
l
l
l

Simple cutting - the text will be cut without moving the letters. This can be also useful if you want to use the outer part of the foam to create a negative text
Advanced cutting - you can apply here Nesting, select different number of letters to cut, create more cuttings for more foam blocks if one is not enough for all the letters. If some
letter includes more parts (for example the 'i' has a dot/circle/square in the upper side) you will be prompted if during the Nesting you want keep the parts together or not.

Save to a .DC1 cad file. The text will be saved as a .DC1 cad file, so you can use it later for example to create a tapered text loading two times (on left and right sides) this and
applying different scale factors

I suggest also to take a look at this page, to better understand some important concepts of devFoam: DevFoam FAQ and important concepts

DevFoam features

How can I cut a more complex text?

How can I cut a more complex text?
If the Cut a text function is not enough for you, you can draw and modify a text using the Cad feature of devFoam .
Using the Cad feature of devFoam You can draw a text element using the commands:
l TEXT - draw a text as a single line
l TEXTC - draw a text using a curved polyline as a Path
l TEXTM - draw multiple line of text
Now you can select the text and cut it using the Simple cutting or the Advanced cutting feature.
If you want further modify the Text before cutting it, you can select it and use the EXPLODE command. It converts the text into Region (Parts), so that you can modify them using the
Cad functions included in devFoam.
For example we can draw a Text, Explode it, and draw a closed Polyline shaped as an arrow, see the picture:
(see also Special cad functions of devFoam to create Regions in a faster and simpler way)

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

Now we can create a region from the polyline, Rotate it and move it over the text, see the picture:

Using the UNION command, we can now create the final Part, see the picture:
(but see also Special cad functions of devFoam to apply BOOLEAN operations a faster and simpler way)

Now you can select it and use the menu 'Cut - Simple foam cutting of selected Parts' to start the Simple cutting dialog:

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 13 of 44

A TwistRot part is a solid generated by a Revolution curve (in the upper dialog a simple segment) rotated on a Axis along a Rotation curve (in the upper dialog a circle) with defined
steps (also called Rotation number, 16 in the upper dialog).
The solid can also be twisted, this explains the TwistRot name.
The cut will performed alternating up and down cutting movements to rotations of the foam block.
A lot of other settings can be applied to get very complex solids. This TwistRot parts are more accurate and faster to cut than a 'Stl Part', so, when possible, we suggest to use TwistRot
part type.
Note: In this page we will refer to a section of the part cut by an horizontal plan (see the transparent cyan plan in the 3D preview) as a watermark section. You can also see the result as
a cyan region in the 2D preview.
In the left side of the dialog you can see the basic and most used parameters and commands.
In the middle a 2D preview, showing the Revolution and Rotation curves.
In the right side the 3D preview.
All the advanced settings can be applied by the menu.
Now we will explain in deep every single part of the dialog.
Left side: the basic and most used parameters and commands
Active quadrant: if you select the Multiquadrant option this control will be enabled. See the 'Revolution curve' menu. For simple parts just ignore it.
Use a Line or an Arc as revolution curve Frame:
If you just need to use a simple Line or Arc as revolution curve, you can just use this frame.
You can set the Bottom and Top distance of the Line or Arc from the rotation axis, the Height of the part, and the Arc bugle. Using a Bulge = 0.0 you will just get a Line.
If you want to use a more complex Revolution curve, see the 'Revolution curve' menu.
Rotation settings Frame:
If you just need to use a circle or an ellipse as Rotation curve, you can just use this frame.
You can set the Rotation number (how many cutting-rotation Jobs will be performed) and the Ratio between the X and Y radius. Using 1.0 you will just get a circle.
If you are using an ellipse, You can also let the application to optimise each rotation angle to have the more accurate result. If not, all the rotations will perform the same angle.
If you want to use a more complex Rotation curve, see the 'Rotation curve' menu.
Twist settings (linear) Frame:
If you just need to use a linear Twist (or no Twist at all), just refer to this dialog.
You can set an upper and lower Twist angle, then the cut will be performed using a linear interpolation between this angles.
You can also decide if you want to apply the Twist also to the ellipse axes, if you are using an ellipse. Nothing changes if you use a circle.
If you want to use a more complex Twist, see the 'Twist' menu.
Default cutting settings Frame:
Here you can apply important refinements to the cut:
The Cutout offset will remove the specified size from the Bottom and Top sides. This size is measured along the vertical line (Z axes of the 3D preview)
The Min axis distance lets you to specify a minimal safe-uncut band from the rotation axis, for the Upper and Lower sides.
l Safe points Offset and Angle: after every cutting, before to apply the next rotation angle, the hot wire will move to these optional safe points. Setting a 0.0 offset no movement will
be applied to that side. Checking the 'Edit Safe Points on 2D Preview' checkbox you can then see and drag 2 blue squares in the 2D preview to graphically set the Safe points.

Middle side: the 2D preview
I think the better thing is to explain what you can see here by colour and line type. Consider also that you can turn on-off some components by the '2D Preview' menu.
Red bold curve: this draws the real cutting line referred to the Active quadrant (usually 0° quadrant).
Black dotted curve: this draws the theoretical cutting curve. This can be modified for example by the Cutout offset. Often you cannot see it as it just under the real Red bold
curve...
l Green lines: these draw the Paths to Safe points.
l Purple line: the Twist curve. Usually vertical.
l Brown line starting from the drawing origin (x=0.0, y=0.0): the rotation axis on 90°-270° plans. Usually vertical.
l Orange line starting from the drawing origin (x=0.0, y=0.0): the rotation axis on 0°-180° plans. Usually vertical and often under the Purple line.
l Black dotted closed curve: this show the max size rotation curve.
l Cyan dotted horizontal line: this is a watermark line. You can move it dragging the vertical slider at the left side of the 2D preview. A transparent cyan plan will be rendered at that
height in the 3D preview.
l Cyan region with black bold contour: this shows the section of the TwistRot part as cut by the watermark plan.The real cutting segment are reported here. You can also see in
Red dotted the normals toe each rotation cut, and the rotation number.
l Light yellow zones with no contour: the Regions drawing the applied Min axis distances.
l Light pink zones with no contour: the Regions drawing the cutout offsets.

Stl part

Stl part
You can get this dialog box pressing the 'Cut Stl part' link located in the Startup dialog
You can use this if you own a Cnc machine with an added rotary axis. If you press ' Cut Stl Part' link the following dialog will appear:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 16 of 44

A Stl part is a solid described by a triangular meshed surface, supplied by an external Stl file.
The Stl file must follow the rules of the Stl standard, or some problem can arise. The application check the most important rules and show a warning is some problem happened.
Stl files are well known, as this is the standard file format used by 3D Printers.
You can generate and modify Stl files using the supplied devStl Tool application, you can run it from the Startup dialog.
For some regular shape may be you will find more convenient to use a 'TwistRot Part', the cut in this case will be more accurate and faster.
The cut will be performed dividing the part in projected section, one for each rotation.
A projected section is the contour of the shadow of the part on a plan, created by a Collimated light (a Collimated light is light whose rays are parallel).
Then, for each rotation, the hotwire will follow the right side of this path. After every cut, the hot wire goes to the safe position (optional), the foam block is rotated, and a new cut applied.
Of course the hotwire cannot render well concavities along its length. So, if the part includes concavities, we suggest to select well the Rotation axis, to minimize them.
If internal holes are created in the Path, they will be ignored. So, again, take your time to evaluate the best Rotation axis.
If possible try to avoid also up/down movements changes during every single cut, this can affect the quality of the final part.
To load a new Stl file use the 'File - Import a Stl file' menu, see below the full description of the menu.
In the left side of the dialog you can see the controls to setup your Stl part.
In the middle a 2D preview, showing the computed projected section for the rotation selected by the horizontal cursor.
In the right side the 3D preview of the Stl part.
Now we will explain in deep every single part of the dialog.
Left side: the parameters and commands
Change rotation axis Frame:
When you import a new Stl file, the original Z axis is used as the rotation axis.
You can here select a new rotation axis between X and Y, considering that the applied rotation axis will be the Z axis, as shown in the 3D picture.
You can also select to invert the orientation of the Z axis, if you want a Top/Down inverted cut.
If this is not enough, as you have a Part with a strange angle, press the 'Rotate the Part to set the right rotation angle' button. You will see in the screen this new window:

You can as first select the axis to use to perform the rotation, and the right View will be displayed in the 3D picture.
Then just press on of the button surrounding the angle step to apply some rotation. Every button will apply a 1 x angle step, 5 x angle step, 15 x angle step.
You can also select to use the Orthogonal view this can help to have a better control over the 3D picture.
Then just press OK to confirm the new settings, or Cancel to ignore them.

Change rotation axis placement Frame:
When you import a new Stl file, the Z will be centered on the Volume Center of the part, considering its max/min X and Y coordinates.
If you need to make more adjustements, just press the 'Move the rotation axis placement' button. You will see in the screen this new window:

You can as first select the axis to use to perform the movement, and the right View will be displayed in the 3D picture.
Then just press on of the button surrounding the distance step to apply some rotation. Every button will apply a 1 x distance step, 5 x distance step, 15 x distance step.
You can also select to use the Orthogonal view this can help to have a better control over the 3D picture.
Then just press OK to confirm the new settings, or Cancel to ignore them.
Cutting parameters:
You select here:
the number of Rotations to apply. When possible we suggest to apply an even number, in this way you can then select to cut the Left/Right side in one shot.
Version 3 includes the possibilty to customize the rotations using the buttons:
¡ Reset - Pressing Reset the number of equispaced rotation will be applied
¡ Customize Rotations - Pressing this button the 'Customize Rotations' dialog will appear. You can then create manually or in automatic way a number of NOT equispaced
rotations, to cut the part in a faster and better way.
¡ Customize Twisted Rotation - Pressing this button the 'Customize Twisted Rotations' dialog will appear. You can then create in automatic way a number of NOT
equispaced and not costant rotations, to cut the part in a faster and better way twisted parts. Using this feature for each cut the rotation angle will chenge to perform the
best possible cut!
l the Profile accuracy. The Profile is the Red bold line displayed in the 2D picture. The higher the accuracy, the longer the computing time.
l

Default cutting settings Frame:
Here you can apply important refinements to the cut:
The Cutout offset will remove the specified size from the Bottom and Top sides. This size is measured along the vertical line (Z axes of the 3D preview)
The Min axis distance lets you to specify a minimal safe-uncut band from the rotation axis, for the Upper and Lower sides.
Safe points Offset and Angle: after every cutting, before to apply the next rotation angle, the hot wire will move to these optional safe points. Setting a 0.0 offset no movement will
be applied to that side. Checking the 'Edit Safe Points on 2D Preview' checkbox you can then see and drag 2 blue squares in the 2D preview to graphically set the Safe points.
l Apply a min distance for the full axis length (it can be negative) from the rotation axis by the "Apply min. axis dist. full len.:" option.
l
l
l

Verify Stl when importing: checking this option, when you import a STL file it will be verified. If the application finds some problem you will advised, so you have the possiblity to fix
them. You can for example use DevStl Tools to fix them, see the Startup dialog to run it. Enabling this option will perform longer processing time during the import job.

Main cutting settings Frame
You can see here the main settings to customize your cut:
Kerf value: the kerf value to apply. The kerf is the thickness of the material melted by the Hot Wire
X offset: the offset applied along the X coordinate, you can verify it in the 2D preview
Y offset: the offset of the rotating axis from the origin, you can verify it in the 2D preview
l Cut starting from the Right side: if enabled the cut will start from the right side (top of the stacked parts)
l Cut Bottom/Top sides in a single step: if your foam block is fixed only at its left side, you can cut the topmost part with a single cut along a Bottom/Top path. This is possible if
the rotation number of the topmost part is even.
l Ignore most right Safe points: if enabled the right (top side of the original part) Safe points of the topmost part will be ignored. You must apply the above single step option to
apply this option
l Use always cutting speed (safer but slower): if enabled all movements will be performed using the cutting speed (G1 commands). This is safer if you are not sure that all the
connecting movements will be outside the foam block.
l Extend In/Out paths to foam size: If enabled added safe movements will be applied to go out of the max foam block size, during connection movements.

Cut by Rotating Table

Cut by Rotating Table
You can get this dialog box pressing the 'Rotating Table type cutting' button located in the 'Cut Stacked part' dialog.
The following dialog will appear:

A Rotating table type Cnc foam cutting machine is a special hot wire foam cutting machine where the foam block can be rotated by an added vertical rotary axis.
The foam block is just placed on the Rotating Table
In the left side of the dialog you can see the controls to setup the cutting job.
In the right side the 2D preview of the cut settings.
Now we will explain in deep every single part of the dialog.
Left side: the parameters and commands
Main cutting settings Frame
You can see here the main settings to customize your cut:
Kerf value: the kerf value to apply. The kerf is the thickness of the material melted by the Hot Wire
X offset: the offset the offset of the rotating axis from the origin, you can verify it in the 2D preview
Y offset: the offset applied along the Y coordinate, you can verify it in the 2D preview
l Cut starting from the Top side: if enabled the cut will start from the top side
l Cut Left/Right sides in a single step: you can cut the topmost part with a single cut along a Left/Right path. This is possible if the rotation number of the topmost part is even. If
not all the cut will be performed at the left side.
l Ignore top side Safe points: if enabled the top side Safe points of the topmost part will be ignored. You must apply the above single step option to apply this option
l Use always cutting speed (safer but slower): if enabled all movements will be performed using the cutting speed (G1 commands). This is safer if you are not sure that all the
connecting movements will be outside the foam block.
l Extend In/Out paths to foam size: If enabled added safe movements will be applied to go out of the max foam block size, during connection movements.
l Safe dist. from Max Parts size: the distance added to the max parts size for the extended safe movements (see above item).
l

How can I draw not Tapered parts?

How can I draw not Tapered (Untapered) parts?
To draw not Tapered parts you can take advantage of the Cad feature included in devFoam.
Note: it You already have a file with the drawing of the not tapered part, you can just cut it in this way:
Click the 'Cut a new Tapered Part' link of the Startup dialog if you already have the 2 vectorial (Dxf, Dwg, Dc1, Hpgl, Plt) or raster (Gif, Jpeg, Bmp, Png, Tif, Tga, Pcx) files including the
drawing/image of the 2 sides of the tapered part you want to create/cut. If enabled you will see the 'Filter and optionally scale elements' dialog if you select a vectorial file, or the
'AutoTrace elements' dialog if you select a raster file. Finally you will se the 'Tapered Part management' dialog where you can create the right cutting path. You can also see this page to
have more info about the 'Available file formats'. To create/cut a new Tapered part you can start from 2 different cases:

To start the Cad feature you can:
l
l

Press the 'Draw and cut not Tapered parts' link in the Startup dialog
Use the menu 'File - New cad'

You will be prompted about the properties of the new Cad document, but you can just press OK to confirm the default settings.
Now you can start to draw....
If you are a Cad novice may be you want go to the first page of the help about Cad, see DevFoam - cad section online guide
The easiest way to create Parts to cut is to draw a closed Polyline , that will be automatically converted to a Part when you go to cut it. See also Special cad functions of devFoam to
create Regions in a faster and simpler way

You can also create a region from the polyline and use the BOOLEAN functions for Regions, see BOOLEAN functions and Special cad functions of devFoam to apply BOOLEAN
operations a faster and simpler way

See also this Example: how can I cut a more complex text?
We suggest to read well this CNC and dirty geometries. How can I clean them?
When you finished to draw the parts select them and use the Simple cutting or the Advanced cutting feature.

Smart Regions

Smart Regions
As devFoam is not a true Cad application, but the Cad part of devFoam Pro is mostly used to draw Parts for foam cutting, we added some smart features to speed up the drawing
process.
To draw in an efficent way the Parts to cut, the suggested way to go is to use Regions.
Using Region you solve the well known problem of Cam application with bad drawn geometries, see also CNC and dirty geometries. How can I clean them?
A Region is always ready to be cut, as it satisfies the requirements that a Cnc application ask to the geometries:
To know which contour are outer or inner, this to apply the kerf at the right side
To have all lines and arcs well connected
l No intersections between contours
l
l

In the normal devCad application you must use special commands to create a region, by selecting the contours or picking a point, for example.

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 23 of 44

As this way to go can be boring and for sure slower, we added the possibility to generate Regions and Island on the fly when you draw a closed element or you import them from a Cad
file.
You can control this by the Smart Regions feature customization dialog
You can access this the Smart Regions feature customization dialog by the 'Fast commands - Customize Smart Regions feature...' menu of the Cad drawing.

For each feature you can select the way it will operate:
Never - the feature won't be applied, devFoam will work here like the usual devCad applicatio
Ask - you will be prompted each time if you want apply the conversion
l Always - the conversion will be applied every time, in a silent way
l
l

When you Import a Dxf, Dwg, Hpgl, Plt or Dat file
In this frame you can customize what happens when you import an external Cad file.
You can also select to ignore not Region elements, if you want a clean import of only Regions.
A second way to Import regions or polylines in the Cad section:
To try this way create a new Cad drawing, then use the "File - Import... - Import Regions from many file types..." or the "File - Import... - Import Polylines from many file types..."
menu.
If enabled you will see the 'AutoTrace elements' dialog if you select a raster file. Finally you will se the Imported regions in your Cad drawing.
Read also this pages Importing regions in a new Cad drawing and Importing polylines in a new Cad drawing.
If the result is not good, enable (if currently disabled) the 'AutoTrace elements' dialog by the Setting link of the Startup dialog and try to adjust as first the Thresold value. Read also well
the 'AutoTrace elements' help page to have more info to the right way to have success.
When you draw a Text
In this frame you can customize what happen when you draw a Text element
When you draw a Closed not autointersecting Element
In this frame you can customize what happen when you draw a Closed not autointersecting Element.
The application will try to apply as first 1) (adding the element as an island), if the feature is enabled.
If 1) is not enabled or no Regions able to get the island exists, will be tried 2)
Other FAST features to convert an already drawn closed and not autointersecting Element into a Region or island:
F_REGION_AI It adds an island
F_REGION_AI It adds an island

No intersections between contours

devFoam adds also Smart functions to create Regions, see Special cad functions of devFoam to create Regions in a faster and simpler way
To create complex Regions the right way is to use Boolean operations like Union, Subtract and Intersection between other Regions.
The standard Boolean Cad operations require to select the Regions involved in the process, and this can be frustrating and for sure takes time.
devFoam added the concept of Fast Boolean operation.
You can find this operations in the 'Fast Command' Cad menu and also in the Fast Toolbar:
But what is the difference between the normal and the Fast Boolean commands?
Using the normal way you must select by hand all the regions you need to process. This takes time.
Using the Fast Boolean Commands you must just select the First Region involved in the process, then press the desired Fast Boolean command, and devFoam will automatically appy it
to Regions underlying the selected Region.
And, still better, if you have just drawn the First Region, you can just apply the Fast Boolean command, and it will be automatically use the latest drawn region as first region. So, when
you are contructiong Parts from scratch, you must just draw a region and apply the Fast Boolean command, without selecting anything!

How can I cut along an already defined vector?

How can I cut along an already defined vector??
You have also the possibility to ignore all the advanced feature for cutting regions or text, may be you want simply cut along a vector (tipically a polyline) drawned by yourself or
imported from DXF or DAT files.
This can be useful if for some reason you want to cut a strange path, and if the path must be opened.
Note: it You already have a file with the drawing of the vector, you can just cut it in this way:
Click the 'Cut Along Vector' link if you already have a vectorial (Dxf, Dwg, Dc1, Hpgl, Plt) or raster (Gif, Jpeg, Bmp, Png, Tif, Tga, Pcx) file including the drawing/image of the
vector/Path you want to cut. If enabled you will see the 'Filter and optionally scale elements' dialog if you select a vectorial file, or the 'AutoTrace elements' dialog if you select a raster file.
Finally you will se the 'Along vector cut' dialog where you can create the right cutting path. Using this feature you can create a cutting path just supplying a vector (for example a
Polyline). You can also see this page to have more info about the 'Available file formats'.
The first operation if to start the Cad feature.
To start the Cad feature you can:
l
l

Press the 'Draw and cut not Tapered parts' link in the Startup dialog
Use the menu 'File - New cad'

You will be prompted about the properties of the new Cad document, but you can just press OK to confirm the default settings.
Now you can start to draw, or you can import a DXF or DAT file.
The usual way is to a Polyline, then you will select it and start the Cut along vector feature by the menu 'Cut - Cut along vector' or clicking the 'Cut along vector' toolbar button.
The selected element can be one of the following Cad types:
l Polyline
l Region (only the external contour will be considered)
l Arc
l Circle
l Spline
l Ellipse
l Elliptic arc
l Smart shape

A Last chance, use a background image in the Cad section
You can set it as a background image in a new Cad document, then trace it. See also And what can do devFoam Pro for the same problem?
Here are the step to follow:
Set the background image
After you created a New Cad document (see Cad feature of devFoam) use the 'Format - Background image - Add background image' menu
You will be prompted to select the image and if/how you want calibrate it. See also Inserting a background raster image in the drawing.
We suggest to select Manual calibration. Calibration is the operation to size the image to the wanted dimension. After pressing OK you will be prompted to click two points whose
distance is known, for example the Height of the picture.
Here is a picture of an example of raster background:

You can also use the menu 'Format - Background image - Set line color of background image' to use a different color, so you can see better the lines you'll go to trace:

Draw closed polylines around the contours
Now you must draw closed Polylines around the contours. We suggest to use polylines so that you haven't to fight against dirty geometries.
You can use lines and arcs, and remember to use the Close command of the command bar to close the polylines as the last step.
After you traced the polylines you can also select and refine them moving the control points.

AutoTrace a Background image

AutoTrace a Background image

Pro version only

AutoTracing a raster image is always a challenging task. There isn't here a perfect mathematical single solution for this problem.
We developed a custom feature to help you to Trace in an automatic or semiautomatic way a Raster image.
A note: we define here as Tracing the conversion of a line/curve of black pixels in a Cad element, like a Polyline, closed Polyline, Circle, Arc, Ellipse, Spline, Closed Spline
As first of course you must add a background raster image to your Drawing. See How to insert a background raster image.
After doing that you will see something similar to the following picture:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 28 of 44

Now click the "Draw - AutoTrace a Background image' main menu, and this new dialog window will appear:

Now you must do 2 steps:
l

Step 1 - Raster preprocessing You must use here the commands included in the first frame to prepare the image to a good Autotracing. See the Raster preprocessing page to

have more info and tips.
l

Step 2 - Tracing elements Now you can use automatic tracing of all elements clicking the 'Trace all elements!' button, or click a point on each of them with the mouse. See
the Tracing elements page to have more info and tips.

In this case we need to cut the Gray shape, so we simply will apply the 'Enhance BORDERS' function. Here below the result of this Preprocessing:

As you can see now the raster image has been modified, and just the Borders are rendered in black. Still no traced elements, but a good starting point to get them. The trick is to create
thin '1 pixel wide' lines.
Now we can just press the 'Trace all elements!' button and the most is done, see the picture below:

devFoam - FAQ

CNC and dirty geometries

CNC and dirty geometries
Sometime a shape appears good to the human eye, but it isn't accepted by a Cam application for your CNC machine.
For example let's take a look at this simple rectangle:

Looks like good, but probably it won't be accepted from a Cam application.
If we take a look at the bottom left corner, zooming it, we can see this:

The corner is opened, because the vertices have slightly different coordinates, they don't match each other!
This is one of the most common cause of dirty geometries.
The rules for a geometry to be a valid contour are:
l
l
l

The vertices must be exactly overimposing (matching)
The contour must be closed
The contour cannot have autointersections

You can see below an example of a contour with an autointersection, and so not clean:

To make this geometry clean you must draw it as 2 triangles.

Clean geometries and Regions
To verify/validate the geometries to be clean DevFoam uses the Region object.
A Region is an element with
l
l
l

1 external clean contour
0, 1, 2 or more internal contours, the islands
an added rule: all those contours cannot intersect each other

Here below an example of a Region with 2 islands:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 33 of 44

Region can always be cut as Parts. That' why we suggest to work with Regions.
To create a Region you can use these commands:
l
l
l
l
l

REGION It converts an object that encloses an area into a region object
REGION_AI It adds an island to a region by selecting its defining objects
REGION_BY_IP It creates a region clicking on an inner point of an enclosed area
REGION_DI It deletes an island from a region
REGION_DIP It deletes an island from a region and it converts it into a polyline

See also this help page about Regions

Hot to create clean geometries
We suggest:
l
l
l

to work with closed Polylines, and not with single Lines and Arcs
to take confidence with the use of Object snaps. In this way you can match vertices with precision
to create Region from Polylines before starting the cutting phase

Hot to clean dirty geometries
If you already drew a dirty geometry, or if you imported it from an external drawing (for example a DXF file), you can clean it.
You can adjust problems caused by unmatching vertices selecting the geometries and moving the BLUE control points of the vertices.
See below:

You can adjust intersection or autointersection problems by moving the vertices or breaking the geometries, see the FULLBREAK command.

A good piece of new: may be devFoam can help you in cleaning geometry
As the cleaning of dirty geometries is a rather annoying and frustrating job, we developed a special feature to help you.
You can try to select the dirty geometries then use the 'Cut - Try automatic Parts generation from selected elements' menu.
This function will try to:
Join together the unmatching vertices , using the max tolerance value set by the 'Cut - Set tolerance for automatic Part generation'. You must define here a value
compatible with the error you can evaluate in vertices matching.
l Split the contours with autointersections in more not autointersecating contours.
l Create Regions and add inner islands if detected.
l

Please note: Region and Parts are about the same thing. Tecnically a Region is a Cad Object defined as help page about Regions.
A Part is a Region that you select and go to Cut. This because Part is the usual term for an object to cut in Cam applications.
Here below an example of very dirty geometries:

Applying the 'Cut - Try automatic Parts generation from selected elements' the result is:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 34 of 44

As you can see valid Regions are created as expected. Also Regions inside Islands have been created.
The original dirty geometries are untouched, but the function creates new Regions.
Enabling the menu 'Cut - Use automatic Parts generation for Cutting', when you select dirty geometries and go to cut them, they will be automatically converted (if possible) in
Regions/Parts. You won't see them in the Cad documents, but only among the Parts to cut. See Simple cutting and Advanced cutting

What is the Cutting path? How can I create and modify it?

What is the Cutting path? How can I create and modify it?
The Cutting Path is the Path generated on the left and right carriages to drive the hot wire and cut the Foam.
For 2D cuts the left and right Path are identical, see What's devFoam?
The concept is similar to a 3 axis CNC milling machine, where a milling tool can cut parts, following the cutting path.
What makes the process difficoult in Foam cutting is the impossibility to break the cutting path and start it again. 3 axys milling machines simply raise the tool over the material to do
that, but that is not possible here.
So the idea here is to build a single continuos cutting path.
Let's make an example: we want to cut 'A' and 'B' letters. See the picture below:

The pink shapes are the geometries of the 2 letters, and the black line is the cutting path created by devFoam. In the bottom left side you can see the Home (the starting/ending point of
the travel of the hot wire). Following the arrows you can see how the external and internal contours of the letters are cut connecting the letters and making a (as little as possible)
cut crossing the letters themselves.
To create a Cutting Path You can select between:
l
l

Simple cutting - the text will be cut without moving the letters/parts. This can be also useful if you want to use the outer part of the foam to create a negative text/part
Advanced cutting - you can apply here Nesting, select different number of letters/parts to cut, create more cuttings for more foam blocks if one is not enough for all the
letters/parts. For the Cut text case, if some letter includes more parts (for example the 'i' has a dot/circle/square in the upper side) you will be prompted if during the Nesting you

want keep the parts together or not.
Cut Laminated Parts if you want to cut Laminated Parts supplying just the thickness and length
l Cut Along Vector if you want create a cutting path just supplying a vector (for example a Polyline).
l Cutting Tapered Parts wizard if you want cut a tapered part.
l

Clicking the Create cut Path button the Path will be created and displayed to the picture, see the example below:

You can see now a black polyline (the Cutting path) with some arrows showing the cut direction.
You can move the entry/exit points and the Home position enabling the Edit mode checkbox.
See the picture showing what happens enabling it:

Now you can see some Blue control points. You can drag and drop them to move the entry/exit points and the Home position.
When you drag a Blue control point on the Cutting path also some little green squares are added: they shows the Vertices of the Cutting Path, so you can move the point to an existing
vertex. The green square also works as snap points, so if you stay near them with the mouse, they will capture the mouse pointer. If you want cancel the current moving action press the
'Esc' button.
If you drop the control point to an invalid part of the cutting path you are alerted by a message and the operation is aborted.
You can use Undo/Redo buttons to Undo/Redo this operations.
See below what happen when you drag a control point: you can see in the red circle (added only here to better explain) the point you are moving and a line connecting the other point of
the original connecting line.

Once the Cutting path is right for you, you can export it in the format you prefer using the buttons included in the upper/right side of the dialog.
You can them import/open this file in the application you use to drive your CNC, see also How can I send the work done in devFoam to my Foam Cutting CNC machine?
In the picture below you can see the 3D preview of the cutting job
The red lines show the real cutting path of each carriage, the green lines the connecting lines, and in orange/cyan the cut parts

devFoam - FAQ

What is the Kerf?

What is the Kerf?
The kerf is the thickness of the foam melted by the Hot Wire.
See the picture below:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 40 of 44

The kerf is always larger (or equal..) to the hot wire diameter.
The slower the hot wire travels, the larger the kerf is.
The hotter is the wire, the larger the kerf is.
You can evaluate the kerf value with a cutting test, with your current speed and temperature values on the same material (there are many different types of foam..).
If you select to apply Kerf (you find this option in the Cutting path page/frame of Simple cutting and Advanced cutting), devFoam will offset the cutting path of half that value, on the
external side of the Part(s).
If you want to have a negative Part (you save the external and trash the real Part) you must apply a negative value.
Just a note: the offset function rounds the convex corners, but that doesn't affect the cut. You can see that in the below picture:

The Blue cutting path rounds the corner, but if you see the Red melted foam you can verify that the corner of the Pink part is then well cut

Cutting by irradiation or by contact

Some brief notes about 2 different way to cut foam:

file:///C:/Users/foaml/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh28C5.htm

11/19/2025

DevFoam startup dialog

Page 41 of 44

By contact
In this way the hot wire touches the foam and melts it by contact. This is the usual way applied when you cut the foam by hand.
Pro:
- you can have faster cutting speed
- the kerf is little, can also be as short as the wire diameter
Cons:
- the hot wire bends and cannot follow well the desired path. This is usually negligible when you cut smooth surfaces, but can create big problems on sharp corner. In this case the
direction change is applied when the hot wire haven't still reached the right position, so a big deformation can occur. To improve this my last application devWing Foam offer the option
to automatically add stop pauses at sharp corners, in this way the hot wire can reach the right position before the direction change is applied
- you must use strong tension to keep the hot wire as straight as possible. This often requires an external bow, or the CNC frame can be over stressed
By irradiation
In this case the foam is melted by the heat irradiated by the hot wire, and the hot wire never touches the foam
Pro:
- the cut is much more precise, as the hot wire doesn't bend but stays straight
- you can use a lower tension to keep the hot wire straight, so you can also use an automatic rewind system, that works well also for strong tapered cuts
Cons:
- you have a slower cutting speed
- the kerf is wider, so you must set it with more accuracy.

How can I send the work done in devFoam to my Foam Cutting CNC machine?

How can I send the work done in devFoam to my Foam Cutting CNC machine?
devFoam dosn't directly drive your CNC machine.
We are making partnership with Companies supplying good controllers and the related Gcode interpreter for Foam cutting.
In the cutting pages You can select one the approved controller/applications then:
l
l

Press the 'Run the selected app. ->' button to create a special GCode file customized for the selected controller/application and run the application with the right file already
loaded
Press the 'Create the right Gcode for ->' button to create a special GCode file customized for the selected controller/application

If your controller is not in that list, there is a lot of good applications to drive your Cnc machine, as for example Mach3 for windows or Emc2 for linux. And also proprietary applications
for some controllers.
So devFoam export the Cutting path to different file formats:
2 Axis Gcode - if you are driving your foam cutting machine as a simple 2 axis, this is the button to create the GCode. You can customize the GCode using the Customize 2 Axis
Gcode button
4 Axis Gcode - if you are driving your foam cutting machine as a 4 axis, this is the button to create the GCode. You can customize the GCode using the Customize 4 Axis
Gcode button
l DXF - DXF files are a standard in Cad applications. You can customize the DXF using the Customize DXF button
l DAT - DAT files are used to describe a single polyline, some CNC driving software likes to import them
l Hpgl/Plt - Hpgl/Plt files are used to describe the plotting of a drawing, some CNC driving softare likes to import them. Only simple command like SP, PU, PD are used here.
l GMFC script .CUT file - if you use GMFC to drive your CNC, you can create a .CUT file and import it in GMFC as a Script file. When you click this button you will be prompted
for some parameters in the GMFC .cut file creation dialog
l
l

You must verify which of these file formats is compatible with your CNC driving application. When possible use GCode, as this is the accepted standard in the Cam world.
To have access to the export features see the Cutting Path page of Simple cutting, Advanced cutting, Cut Laminated Parts, Cut Along Vector and Cutting Tapered Parts wizard features.

How can I select the Units (mm/inches) and the precision of the output files?

How can I select the Units (mm/inches) and the precision of the output files?
A Cad document of devFoam can use many different Units, but in the Cam/Cnc world only millimeters and inches are usually considered.
And switching from mm to inches or viceversa is not an usual task. Probably if you selected to work with mm all your Cutting paths will use mm.
So devFoam set the Cutting path export Units as a global parameter.
You will use the 'Cut - Cutting Unit of measurement' menu to select the Unit.
The same for the Cutting Tolerance of the exported Cutting path.
But what is it? When you are going to cut for example an Arc, it will be rendered as many little lines in the Cutting path. The Cutting Tolerance value set the max distance between the
original arc and the lines of the Cutting path. The lower the Cutting Tolerance, the larger the number of lines (and the size of the exported Cutting path).
You will use the 'Cut - Cutting Tolerance' menu to set the Cutting Tolerance value.
This is different from the Tolerance value of a Cad document, as that defines the precision of the rendering of curves just inside the Cad document.

How can I preview the cutting job?
Previewing the cutting job is very simple, just press the '3D Preview of the cutting' button located int the Cutting Path page of Simple cutting and Advanced cutting features.
When you run devSim Cnc Foam, you can see the "Main dialog":

The dialog is divided in three logical frames and a menu:
The menu
The menu is placed as usually in the upper side of the dialog. It includes these commands:
File - Open Gcode. You are prompted for a valid GCode file to load. The same as the Load button of the Control panel (see below).
File - Import .cut file created by GMFC. You can open here a .cut file of GMFC and convert it to a new GCode file, already loaded as a new Job. You can create this file in
GMFC checking the 'Cut to file' option in the dialog opened by the 'Cut - Panel cut' main menu of GMFC application.
l Settings. The Settings dialog will appear. You can customize there the settings of the application
l Help - Go to the Help file. This Help will be shown.
l

Left - the Control panel
The Control panel includes the main buttons to control the cutting job, and some display to show interesting values like axes position and speed.
In the top side you can see these buttons (some of them can be grayed, when the associated function is not available at the current state):
Load - This button promptes you for a valid GCode file. The file will be loaded and displayed in the edit box included in the middle of the dialog.
Rewind - Reset the cutting to the begin of the Gcode file
Start/Unpause back the job execution - Will start or unpause the cutting job in the back direction (From End to Begin)
l Pause - The cutting job is paused, you must press then Start or again Pause to resume the cutting at the paused place.
l Start/Unpause the job execution - Will start or unpause the cutting job in the normaldirection (From Begin to End)
l Set the execution at the end of the Job - Set the cutting to the end of the Gcode file
l Exit: devSim Cnc Foam close, if the cutting job is not running, or you will be prompted to stop it and press again the Exit button.

Near the value you can see an edit button

. Pressing this button a menu will appear, where you can

Set the origin here: using this command the origin will be placed at the current position of the referred axis. The axis won't move and the value displayed will be then 0.0
¡ Go to 0.0: the referred axis will move to its origin = 0.0
¡ Go to (absolute move): you will be prompted for the value where the referred axis will move, as an absolute value referred to the origin = 0.0
¡ Go to (relative move): you will be prompted for the value where the referred axis will move, as a realtive value referred to current position
l SC - you can read here the current Speed of the specified carriage. The value will be in millimeters/min or inches/min, depending on the option selected in the 'Settings - Units'
dialog.
l SF - you can read here the current Speed of the wire at the Left/Right side of the Foam block. If you are performing a tapered cut you can see differenet speeds at carriages and
foam sides. The value will be in millimeters/min or inches/min, depending on the option selected in the 'Settings - Units' dialog.
¡

Show parsed Pseudo code in listing: if unchecked you will see the loaded GCode, if checked you will see the commands displayed using the way the application did interpret the
GCode. In the Move and Cut commands you can also see the applied Speed (S) and the time reserved to that command (T).
The GCode panel lets you to see the loaded Gcode or the Pseudo Code, see the above comment.
When you load the Gcode, it will be displayed in the big text control in the middle of the screen. When running the cutting job, the line in execution will be selected and marked with a red
circle.
When the Execution is not running, you can also double click a line to set the current job position at the line.
